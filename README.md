# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm

This robot is a 5-DOF robotic arm that moves in response to our hand movements. Basically, you wear a glove on one of your hands, and as you move your fingers, the robot moves and can perform tasks on your behalf. It can be used in industries and different companies to automate and make there task faster. This will help companies and industries to save there labors cost and spend that money on other sectors. It can also be used in household tasks like watering plants at specific times so the plants don't die, or elderly people can use it to help them hold items or move small items from one place to another. While this may sound like "robots replacing humans," it will also help create more job opportunities, as skilled programmers and engineers are required to make this at a larger scale.
